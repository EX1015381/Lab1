### **Lab Overview**

In this lab, you need to identify and correct all logical and syntax errors within the `first.c` and `second.c` source files. To receive a perfect score, your corrected code must pass **all automated tests**.

* The corrected `second.c` program must add two integers that sum to `120`, and then display this result.
